# Introduction to Java programming language


## Quick overview of Java programming lanaguage
<br>


Java is an object-oriented, class-based, and concurrent programming language. It is designed to be portable, meaning that Java code written on one platform can be run on another platform with little or no modification. Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, and is known for its simplicity, security, and scalability.

Here's a simple "Hello World" program in Java:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
```

## Overview of Java development environment:
<br>

Java development environment refers to the tools, libraries, and platforms that are used to develop Java applications. The most commonly used development environment for Java is the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Java compiler, and other tools.

In addition to the JDK, you may also use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans, to write, test, and debug your Java code. An IDE provides a more user-friendly interface for developing Java applications and often includes features like code highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.

## Setting up Java development environment on a Mac:
<br>

To set up your Java development environment on a Mac, you need to install the JDK. The latest version of the JDK is OpenJDK, which is available for free. Here are the steps to install OpenJDK on a Mac:
<br>


1. Open the Terminal application.
<br>

2. Run the following command to install the latest version of the OpenJDK:
<br>


    ```shell
    brew install --cask temurin
    ```
<br>

3. Verify if Java is installed
<br>

    ```shell
    java --version
    ```

## Installing and setting up IntelliJ IDEA on a Mac

<br>
IntelliJ IDEA is a popular IDE for Java development. Here are the steps to install and set up IntelliJ IDEA on a Mac:

<br>

1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ and download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA from the JetBrains website.

<br>

2. Open the downloaded file to start the installation process.

<br>


3. Follow the instructions to install IntelliJ IDEA on your Mac.

<br>

4. Once the installation is complete, open IntelliJ IDEA.

<br>


5. Follow the prompts to configure the IDE, including selecting the plugins and themes you want to use.

<br>

6. To create a new Java project, click on "Create New Project" from the welcome screen.

<br>

7. Follow the prompts to configure the project, including selecting the JDK and project location.

<br>

8. Once the project is created, you can start writing your Java code in the editor.
